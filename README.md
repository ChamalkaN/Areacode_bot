# Areacode_bot
This is a simple bot crated for Google Assistant using Dialogflow (formerly Api.ai). You can find any area code in Sri Lanka just by telling the district.
The areacodes and districts are taken from Wikipedia.
Login to your Dialogflow console and import the files. 
You can integrate this dialogflow source with any social media that mentiones in dialog flow documentation which you can find here,
